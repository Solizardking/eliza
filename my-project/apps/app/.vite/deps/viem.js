* - Docs: https://viem.sh/docs/contract/writeContract
* - Examples: https://stackblitz.com/github/wevm/viem/tree/main/examples/contracts_writing-to-contracts
*
* A "write" function on a Solidity contract modifies the state of the blockchain. These types of functions require gas to be executed, and hence a [Transaction](https://viem.sh/docs/glossary/terms) is needed to be broadcast in order to change the state.
*
* Internally, uses a [Wallet Client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet) to call the [`sendTransaction` action](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/wallet/sendTransaction) with [ABI-encoded `data`](https://viem.sh/docs/contract/encodeFunctionData).
*
* __Warning: The `write` internally sends a transaction – it does not validate if the contract write will succeed (the contract may throw an error). It is highly recommended to [simulate the contract write with `contract.simulate`](https://viem.sh/docs/contract/writeContract#usage) before you execute it.__
*

* An Authorization can be instantiated from an [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702) Authorization tuple in object format.

*

*   nonce: 69n,
* })
* ```
*
* @example
* ### Attaching Signatures
*
* A {@link ox#Signature.Signature} can be attached with the `signature` option. The example below demonstrates signing
* an Authorization with {@link ox#Secp256k1.(sign:function)}.
*
* ```ts twoslash

*   nonce: 40n,
* })
*
* const signature = Secp256k1.sign({
*   payload: Authorization.getSignPayload(authorization),
*   privateKey: '0x...',
* })
*
* const authorization_signed = Authorization.from(authorization, { signature }) // [!code focus]
* ```

* Parses an arbitrary **JSON ABI Function** or **Human Readable ABI Function** into a typed {@link ox#AbiFunction.AbiFunction}.
*
* @example
* ### JSON ABIs
*
* ```ts twoslash
* import { AbiFunction } from 'ox'
*
* const approve = AbiFunction.from({
*   type: 'function',
*   name: 'approve',
*   stateMutability: 'nonpayable',
*   inputs: [
*     {
*       name: 'spender',
*       type: 'address',

*
*

*   'function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) returns (bool)' // [!code hl]

*
* @example
* It is possible to specify `struct`s along with your definitions:
*
* ```ts twoslash
* import { AbiFunction } from 'ox'
*
* const approve = AbiFunction.from([
*   'struct Foo { address spender; uint256 amount; }', // [!code hl]
*   'function approve(Foo foo) returns (bool)',
* ])
*
* approve
* //^?
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
* ```
*

* @param abiFunction - The ABI Function to parse.
* @returns Typed ABI Function.

/**
* Extracts an {@link ox#AbiFunction.AbiFunction} from an {@link ox#Abi.Abi} given a name and optional arguments.
*
* @example
* ### Extracting by Name
*
* ABI Functions can be extracted by their name using the `name` option:
*
* ```ts twoslash
* import { Abi, AbiFunction } from 'ox'
*
* const abi = Abi.from([
*   'function foo()',
*   'event Transfer(address owner, address to, uint256 tokenId)',
*   'function bar(string a) returns (uint256 x)',

*
* const item = AbiFunction.fromAbi(abi, 'foo') // [!code focus]
* //    ^?
*
*
*
*
*
*
* ```
*
* @example
* ### Extracting by Selector
*
* ABI Functions can be extract by their selector when {@link ox#Hex.Hex} is provided to `name`.
*
* ```ts twoslash
* import { Abi, AbiFunction } from 'ox'
*
* const abi = Abi.from([
*   'function foo()',
*   'event Transfer(address owner, address to, uint256 tokenId)',
*   'function bar(string a) returns (uint256 x)',

* //    ^?
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
* ```
*
* :::note
*
* Extracting via a hex selector is useful when extracting an ABI Function from an `eth_call` RPC response or
* from a Transaction `input`.
*

*
* @param abi - The ABI to extract from.
* @param name - The name (or selector) of the ABI item to extract.

*
* - Docs: https://viem.sh/docs/actions/public/waitForTransactionReceipt
* - Example: https://stackblitz.com/github/wevm/viem/tree/main/examples/transactions_sending-transactions
* - JSON-RPC Methods:
*   - Polls [`eth_getTransactionReceipt`](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_getTransactionReceipt) on each block until it has been processed.
*   - If a Transaction has been replaced:
*     - Calls [`eth_getBlockByNumber`](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_getblockbynumber) and extracts the transactions
*     - Checks if one of the Transactions is a replacement
*     - If so, calls [`eth_getTransactionReceipt`](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_getTransactionReceipt).
*
* The `waitForTransactionReceipt` action additionally supports Replacement detection (e.g. sped up Transactions).
*
* Transactions can be replaced when a user modifies their transaction in their wallet (to speed up or cancel). Transactions are replaced when they are sent from the same nonce.
*
* There are 3 types of Transaction Replacement reasons:
*
* - `repriced`: The gas price has been modified (e.g. different `maxFeePerGas`)
* - `cancelled`: The Transaction has been cancelled (e.g. `value === 0n`)
* - `replaced`: The Transaction has been replaced (e.g. different `value` or `data`)
*
* @param client - Client to use
* @param parameters - {@link WaitForTransactionReceiptParameters}

/**
* Executes a write function on a contract synchronously.
* Returns the transaction receipt.
*
* - Docs: https://viem.sh/docs/contract/writeContractSync
*
* A "write" function on a Solidity contract modifies the state of the blockchain. These types of functions require gas to be executed, and hence a [Transaction](https://viem.sh/docs/glossary/terms) is needed to be broadcast in order to change the state.
*
* Internally, uses a [Wallet Client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet) to call the [`sendTransaction` action](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/wallet/sendTransaction) with [ABI-encoded `data`](https://viem.sh/docs/contract/encodeFunctionData).
*
* __Warning: The `write` internally sends a transaction – it does not validate if the contract write will succeed (the contract may throw an error). It is highly recommended to [simulate the contract write with `contract.simulate`](https://viem.sh/docs/contract/writeContract#usage) before you execute it.__
*
* @param client - Client to use
* @param parameters - {@link WriteContractParameters}
